/// A live database handle capable of executing queries and spawning transactions.

/// This trait extends [`Executor`] adding functionality to acquire a connection
/// and to begin transactional scopes.
///
/// Drivers implement concrete `Connection` types to expose backend-specific
/// behavior (timeouts, pooling strategies, prepared statement caching, etc.).
///
/// # Lifecycle
/// - `connect` creates (or fetches) an underlying connection. It may eagerly
///   establish network I/O for validation; always await it.
/// - `begin` starts a transaction returning an object implementing
///   [`Transaction`]. Commit / rollback MUST be awaited to guarantee resource
///   release.
