The `Executor` trait provides a uniform, async/stream-based interface for:
- Preparing parameterized queries (`prepare`)
- Running arbitrary queries yielding heterogeneous results (`run`)
- Convenience adapters to obtain only rows (`fetch`) or only affected counts (`execute`)
- Bulk data ingestion (`append`), with graceful fallback for drivers lacking append semantics.

Streams:
`run` yields `QueryResult` items. Higher-level helpers (`fetch`, `execute`) filter & map only the
variants they care about, propagating errors while discarding unrelated items.

Lifetimes:
`fetch` ties the stream lifetime `'s` to `&'s mut self`, ensuring the executor outlives row decoding.

Fallbacks:
`append` always emits an INSERT when the driver has no dedicated append/merge support.

Awaiting:
Every method returning a Future or Stream must be awaited / polled to completion. Some drivers
might perform effects before awaiting, but relying on that is undefined behavior across drivers.
